Make `install_gdal.sh` and `run.sh` file executable using followinf command

At the command line, run 
`chmod u+x install_gdal.sh` and  `chmod u+x run.sh`

Open your terminal and run file called `install_gdal.sh` using the command as
```bash
./install_gdal.sh
```

Once the installation is completed note town the file path to `.tiff` file.

Amend the script with the file location and output file name in the `run.sh` file using your text editor.

```bash
./run.sh
```
😎 Well done!

Sit back and relax, let script do it magic 🪄!
